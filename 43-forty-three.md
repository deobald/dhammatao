The softest thing in the universe
Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe.
That without substance can enter where there is no room.
Hence I know the value of non-action.

Teaching without words and work without doing
Are understood by very few.


## NOTES ##

The soft/hard duality and image of substancelessness have obvious interpretations on the scale of nations, wars, societies, cultures, families, and individuals. Igo is a wonderful microcosm for such human interaction and a useful analog for reflecting on the effects of meditation in retrospect.

As Vipassana is a moving meditation, there is "work" though the meditator is not "doing" anything. The lessons to be learned from Vipassana cannot be taught by language — or they would be already. Some of these lessons are non-paradoxical and can be captured in platitudes: "Those who are the hardest to love are the ones who need it most." and so forth. Such clichés do not convey the teaching.

This can be related in terms of the very "work [done] without doing". The systematic observation of bodily sensations requires effort. At first, it requires substantial effort and can feel quite mechanical. As one works on the technique, the effort becomes lighter, softer, less effortful. As this progressively improves physical spaces of the nervous system can be penetrated, where they previously could not, both deeper inside one's body and on a smaller scale (say, feeling an individual hair as opposed to an area of the skin measured in inches). This is "entering where there is no room." Here, when Igo is used for reflection, it is a helpful microcosm again — this time modelling human biology and mind/body interactions.
