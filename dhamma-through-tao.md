I will use the Gia Fu-Feng / Jane English translation, despite the fact that it is outdated and has been proven to be based on a scroll containing the poems in the incorrect order. As English translations go, this remains my favourite. I may cross-reference the Victor H. Mair translation in the future.

# In your own plate #

The instruction of nervous-system-based Vipassana meditation courses (http://www.dhamma.org) suggests that one re-frame the teaching in a language preferred by individual meditators. Using a simile of a dish of kheer served to a child who demands it served in her own plate and to have the cardamom taken out, Goenka suggests on the last day of an introductor Vipassana course that one should reframe the teaching and take out disagreeable theory as one desires.

I have no intention of removing any theory from the teaching of Vipassana. This activity is also more an elucidation of the Tao te Ching than it is a reframing of Vipassana instruction in other words.

This text and this practice are, collectively, the most valuable thing of which I am aware.
