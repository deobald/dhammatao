```
Accept disgrace willingly.
Accept misfortune as the human condition.

What do you mean by "Accept disgrace willingly"?
Accept being unimportant.
Do not be concerned with loss or gain.
This is called "accepting disgrace willingly."

What do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"?
Misfortune comes from having a body.
Without a body, how could there be misfortune?

Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things.
Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.

## NOTES ##

```
Accept disgrace willingly.
...
Do not be concerned with loss or gain.
```

The awareness of our own mental states caused by probing our own nervous system with direct attention tends to be acute, and not always pleasant. Everyone has both selfish and destructive thoughts and unless one is a perfect meditator (we aren't), attention will move between the thoughts and the bodily sensations which correspond to those thoughts. These thoughts are often "disgraceful".

```
Accept being unimportant.
```

In Buddhist philosophy: non-self, substancelessness, Anatta, अनात्मन्. You are a _force_, not a persitent entity. This belief is unimportant. It is observed directly through the dissolution of the body.

```
Misfortune comes from having a body.
```

Objective attention of bodily sensation, which is the core component of Vipassana, appears to "dissolve" the body to our attention. The well-documented end result is Bhanga (Pali) or भङ्ग (Sanskrit) — total dissolution of the body to our awareness.

Vipassana does this systematically:

1. Dissolve the skin/hair to your attention
2. Dissolve the muscles and internal organs
3. Dissolve the spinal cord

Even an incomplete experience of bhanga will cause one to feel "oneness" with the universe (though perhaps the meaning will be misinterpeted, as I have done in the past). Modern neuroscience declares that our sense of self is "rooted in a body state", so this consequence of the practice of Vipassana makes complete sense. Without feeling as though we have a body, we will not feel as though we have a "self".

```
Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things.
```

"Trust" here is in some global sense. A partial experience of these truths (impermanence of the body known experientially and the resultant feeling of non-self) will make a person humble. This makes some sense, as we even experience such humility (albeit on a very small scale) watching the world news or listening to Carl Sagan. Surrender/humility/trust are in this passage perhaps one and the same. One who truly does not see herself as important is more likely to be trusted than someone who puts herself at the centre of the universe.

```
Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.
```

As one has a clearer vision of one's own impermanent reality, one becomes increasingly careful. Why this occurs is beyond me. This change progresses in very small steps but it would seem that with enough practice one will not differentiate between the outside world and the world inside one's own body (the "self") at all. At this point, by extrapolation, it seems maximum care would be given to every action.
