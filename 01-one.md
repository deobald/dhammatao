The Tao that can be tols is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.
Those two spring from the same source but differ in name;
  this appears as darkness
Darkness within darkness.
The gate to all mystery.


## NOTES ##

> The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
> The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

It is impossible to explain even the simplest effects of Vipassana. Insights gained exist clearly in the mind of the experiencer, yet there is no way to communicate them verbally.

> The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
> The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.

When one meditates, experiences without conceptualization demonstrate to the meditator the origination of both that which can be described (Earth) and that which cannot (Heaven). Conceptualization itself causes manifestation.

> Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
> Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.

Desire (craving), or desire-not (aversion), would seem to be the only true hindrance to experiencing the indescribable.

> Those two spring from the same source but differ in name;
>   this appears as darkness.
> Darkness within darkness.
> The gate to all mystery.

In deep meditation (both Samatha and Vipassana), their nondual nature can be perceived.
