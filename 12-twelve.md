The five colors blind the eye.
The five tones deafen the ear.
The five flavors dull the taste.
Racing and hunting madden the mind.
Precious things lead one astray.

Therefore the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees.
He lets go of that and chooses this.

These lines work on many levels. At the grossest level, they represent desire/craving as it pertains to the physical world and it's progressively unsatisfactory nature. However, it also refers to the consequences of tempering one's consumption at this same gross level. After days of deep meditation, our sense lucidity returns to something we might remember from childhood: food tastes better, colours are more brilliant, sounds more fascinating. Touch and smell are affected similarly. The effects can be likened to those of LSD or MDMA â€” clearly operating in the mundane sphere. Similar effects can be gained from a long backpacking trip in the mountains away from the overstimulation of modern life.

On a much subtler level, the in-the-moment effects of Vipassana also tend to cause sensory input (or the appearance of). In altered states of consciousness, supramundane experiences of horror and bliss alike distract the mind. These, too, dull the senses if the meditator focuses on them.

Whether mundane or supramundane, escaping undesirable experiences and chasing desirable experiences causes more damage to the mind and, in the immediate, distracts one from the practice of Vipassana.

Though this applies at both levels, it is more approachable to discuss it within the mundane sphere. While walking, eating, sleeping, talking, and loving the "sage" keeps her attention inside her own body ("what he feels", "this") rather than on external sense objects ("that").

To control one's attention in such a way, continuously, is obviously nontrivial and the title of "sage" is not unwarranted.
